* NoTouchID (1.0.3)

Disables support for Touch ID, which is useful to prevent lags on auth dialogs. This occurs on
SMBIOS versions where Touch ID is expected, e.g. MacBookPro15,1 that we're using for the XPS 9570.

* Lilu (1.4.1)
https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu
An open source kernel extension bringing a platform for arbitrary kext, library, and program
patching throughout the macOS. Required by WhateverGreen and other kexts.
* VirtualSMC/SMCBatteryManager/SMCLightSensor/SMCProcessor/SMCSuperIO (1.1.0)
https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC
Apple SMC emulator. Required to boot macOS on a hackintosh, since PCs
do not have Apple SMC hardware.
* Sintekek-rtsx (2.2)
https://github.com/cholonam/Sinetek-rtsx
macOS driver for Realtek SD card readers. This allows the use of the internal PCIe SD card reader 

* Notes
All kexts are release versions, if both debug and release are provided.

+Kexts should also be installed to /Library/Extensions.+
Kexts should be installed only in CLOVER/kexts/Other, and _not_ in /Library/Extensions.

This seems to work well and provides more flexibility, but if you run into any issues doing this,
please report it.
