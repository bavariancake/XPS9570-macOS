* Overview
Run macOS Mojave (10.14) on a Dell XPS 9570.

Most pieces are fully supported, and this setup can be used as your main machine. A few pieces are
missing (and some will probably never be supported); see Known Problems/Caveats in the Hardware
section.

The EFI folder can be used to boot into a USB installer, or for regular booting.

* Hardware
** Graphics
Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630 support is handled by [[https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen][WhateverGreen]], and configured in the
=PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)= section of config.plist. The Nvidia GPU is not supported due to hardware
differences and lack of driver support in macOS. It is disabled to save power.

Choose a DPCD maximum link rate for your display, where 4K=0x14 (default) or 1080p=0x0a.

To determine if Intel GPU (IGPU) acceleration is working, check: =About This Mac -> Intel UHD Graphics 630
1536 MB=. A value less than 1536MB indicates a problem (e.g. 7MB or 31MB are common).

The default BIOS DVMT pre-alloc value of 64MB is sufficient and does not need to be changed.

The IGPU supports [[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025672/graphics-drivers.html][up to 3 displays]] simultaneously, including the internal LCD. The type C port
supports up to two DisplayPort connections with an adapter. Even though you could connect three
external displays (HDMI + 2 DisplayPort via type C), one of these displays would remain powered
off. This is a limitation of IGPU, which has 3 pipelines for driving displays, one per display.

*** Enabling external display support
Without any options passed to WhateverGreen, a KP will occur whenever an HDMI device is
attached. @0xFireWolf provided initial required flags in [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/fix-coffee-lake-intel-uhd-graphics-630-on-macos-mojave-hdmi-output-issue-public-testing-stage.275126/][a thread]] to support HDMI 1.4 connections,
with some quirks for HDMI 2.0 connections. Testing is still in progress.

Up to two 4k@60Hz DisplayPort connections are supported via type C with adapter, and HDMI can also
be connected. However, the internal display will turn off if three external displays are connected
(see Intel GPU limitation above).

Connector 0 is the internal LCD, connectors 1 and 2 are DisplayPort via type C, and connector 3 is
HDMI. The boot argument =agdpmod=vit9696= is required to disable board checks, since the
=MacBookPro15,1= doesn't have an HDMI output, and would be ignored by the OS by default.

** PS/2 Keyboard
The internal keyboard is a PS/2 device, but macOS does not support PS/2. This can be implemented
with VoodooPS2Controller.
*** Installation

  - See list of [[https://wiki.osdev.org/PS/2_Keyboard][PS/2 scan codes (scan code set 1)]] for codes generated by keyboard, and [[file:/System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HIToolbox.framework/Versions/A/Headers/Events.h][ADB key codes]]
    for codes recognized by macOS.
*** Debugging key codes
- Install debug version of VoodooPS2Controller
- Log key codes captured
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  log stream | sed -n 's/.*\(ApplePS2Keyboard: sending key\)/\1/p'
  #+END_SRC
*** Known problems/caveats
- Can cause reboot on startup (intermittent)
- Keyboard options like modifier key settings cause an erratic/disabled keyboard
  For key remapping, see SSDT-PS2-Keymap.dsl above. Key repeat speed and delay are ok to change.
- Can't wake up from sleep with internal keyboard
- Enables poor quality touchpad by default
** Wi-Fi/Bluetooth
Based on [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/broadcom-wifi-bluetooth-guide.242423/][Broadcom Wi-Fi Bluetooth Guide]], and see threads [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/wip-guide-hp-envy-x360-13-y013cl-i7-7500u-kaby-lake.213327/page-17][one]] and [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/solved-handoff-continuity-auto-unlock-not-working-bcm94360cd-asrock-fatal1ty-z97x-killer.239277/][two]].

One possible replacement card is the Dell DW1830, based on the Broadcom BCM943602BAED. I've used
this card here (purchased on EBay), although it's currently a bit expensive at around $50. Dell no
longer offers this card directly.

This card has three antennas, while the XPS 9570 has only two antennas in the display. To get full
Wi-Fi speed, a third antenna with a U.FL connector must be added. This antenna can be placed in a
small gap next to the battery. It's OK to leave J2 unconnected, however - modern network cards
should recognize this and disable the 3rd port. Without the 3rd antenna, I'm able to get speeds up
to about 800Mbps.

Connectors J0, J1, J2 should be connected as follows (see [[file:images/3rd_antenna.jpg][installation example]]):

  - J0: white antenna cable to display (primary)
  - J1: black antenna cable to display (Bluetooth/secondary)
  - J2: extra retrofitted antenna next to battery

The DW1830 Wi-Fi card is based on the Broadcom BCM943602BAED, using BCM43602 for Wi-Fi and BCM20703
for Bluetooth. While Wi-Fi works by default, it shows up as a "Third-Party Wireless Card" in System
Information unless AirportBrcmFixup is installed, and Bluetooth requires kexts from
OS-X-BrcmPatchRAM.
*** Installation
- Include [[https://github.com/acidanthera/AirportBrcmFixup][AirportBrcmFixup]] [[file:EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other/AirportBrcmFixup.kext][AirportBrcmFixup.kext]] for Wi-Fi
- Include [[https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-BrcmPatchRAM][OS-X-BrcmPatchRAM]] [[file:EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other/BrcmPatchRAM2.kext][BrcmPatchRAM2.kext]] and [[file:EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other/BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext][BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext]] for Bluetooth (for installation to /Library/Extensions)
- After swapping out Wi-Fi card, reset Bluetooth info (e.g. to fix AirDrop)
  - Turn off Bluetooth
  - =sudo rm -f /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist*=
  - Reboot and turn on Bluetooth
- Ensure that Wi-Fi adapter's BSD name is =en0=
  - SysPrefs -> Click on Network dropdown -> BSD Device Name for Wi-Fi not =en0=? Continue below, otherwise skip.
  - =sudo rm -f /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist=
  - =sudo rm -f /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist=
  - Reboot
*** Testing Wi-Fi speed
By default, AirportBrcmFixup seems to limit Wi-Fi channel width for 802.11ac to 40MHz instead of
80MHz, even though the country code defaults to US. The workaround is to disable the country code
setting with the boot flag =brcmfx-country=#a= ([[file:EFI/CLOVER/config.plist][config.plist]]).

If you have an 802.11ac capable access point, place the XPS 9570 next to it and option-click on the
Wi-Fi icon. After a few minutes, you should see a line like =Channel: 165 (5 GHz, 80 MHz)= with =Tx
Rate= below it of 800 Mbps or higher. A congested Wi-Fi environment in an apartment building could
reduce this rate.
*** Messages and FaceTime setup
The above installation steps prepare the way for Messages and FaceTime to work as well, but there
are more in-depth guides to Messages [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/an-idiots-guide-to-imessage.196827/][here]] and [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/how-to-fix-imessage.110471/][here]] if needed.

If there are issues with continuity (switching calls between macOS and iPhone for example),
BT4LEContiunityFixup.kext may help fix those, but seems to not be needed for the DW1830.

Remove stale Messages and FaceTime data:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Messages
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iCloudHelper
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat*
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.icloud*
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ids.service*
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imagent.plist
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imessage*
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice*
#+END_SRC
*** Known problems/caveats
- Unlock with Apple Watch only works once after actviation, or only sporadically
** Battery status
Install [[file:EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other/SMCBatteryManager.kext][SMCBatteryManager.kext]] that comes with [[https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC][VirtualSMC]] to get battery status. Ensure that you
have removed ACPIBatteryManager if you've installed it previously.
** Audio
Audio on the XPS 9570 is based on the Realtek ALC298 audio codec, referred to by Dell as "ALC3266-CG
with Waves MaxxAudio Pro". The ALC298 is not supported on macOS by default, so we use AppleALC to
enable it. Audio pipelines on laptops appear to have unique amplifier and gain setups, so we need to
pass a =layout-id= to AppleALC compatible with the XPS 9570. The only ID that works well is
=layout-id=30=.

HDMI audio output probably requires SSDT-HDEF and FakePCIID_Intel_HDMI_Audio.kext, but is not
implemented yet since it depends on a graphics fix.
*** Installation
- [[file:EFI/CLOVER/config.plist][config.plist]]
  - =Devices/Properties/PciRoot(0)/Pci(0x1f,3)=
    - =Comment: AppleALC layout-id for ALC298 on XPS 9570=
    - =layout=id=30=
- Install [[https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC][AppleALC]] [[file:EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other/AppleALC.kext][kext]]
*** Known problems/caveats
- A bad =layout-id= causes constant CPU activity in a =kernel_task= process (30 should be ok)
- Lack of an audio output device causes video playback problems, i.e. stalling when seeking
- HDMI audio out not implemented since HDMI out causes kernel panic (dependent on graphics fix)
** USB
The XPS 9570 DSDT table has a few incorrect USB properties, for example the right side type A port
is marked as being internal, so an attached disk can't be easily ejected. The correct properties are
injected via USBInjectAll and in [[file:EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/SSDT-UIAC.dsl][SSDT-UIAC.dsl]].

Based on [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-10-11-usb-changes-and-solutions.173616/][USB guide]] and [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-creating-a-custom-ssdt-for-usbinjectall-kext.211311/][companion guide.]]

*** Known issue: left side type C port only works in HS mode, not SS
Will likely work when USB type C and/or Thunderbolt fixes are added.
*** To-Do: Add [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-usb-power-property-injection-for-sierra-and-later.222266/][USB power property injection]]
** Thunderbolt 3
Thunderbolt 3 can be made to work if "BIOS assist enumeration" is enabled for Thunderbolt in the
BIOS. Install the latest Thunderbolt firmware update from Dell, then boot into Windows with TB
peripheral attached. Set device to "always allow". TB device will work in macOS when attached prior
to boot, but will lose functionality when hotplugged.
** Touch ID / Goodix fingerprint sensor
It's [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/solved-asus-ux430ua-fingerprint-trackpad-touch-id.230671/#post-1572495][not possible]] to use fingerprint sensor for Touch ID according to RehabMan. Perhaps the
integrated Goodix fingerprint sensor can be used, and enabled with PAM (TBD).

Since we're using the =MacBookPro15,1= SMBIOS, macOS is expecting Touch ID to be available, causing
lag on password prompts. This can be disabled for now with the NoTouchID kext.

- Install [[https://github.com/al3xtjames/NoTouchID][NoTouchID]] [[file:EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other/NoTouchID.kext][kext]]
** Touchpad and touchscreen
Both the Synaptics touchpad and Wacom touchscreen are I2C devices that can be driven with
[[https://github.com/alexandred/VoodooI2C][VoodooI2C]]. [[https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Voodoo-PS2-Controller][VoodooPS2Controller]] also provides basic touchpad support, but the quality is not as good.

** VirtualSMC/FakeSMC
Either [[https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC][VirtualSMC]] or [[https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-FakeSMC-kozlek][FakeSMC]] is required to boot macOS, since PCs don't have Apple SMC
hardware. VirtualSMC is newer and actively maintained.
*** Installation

- Include [[file:EFI/CLOVER/drivers64UEFI/VirtualSmc.efi][VirtualSmc.efi]], and remove SMCHelper-64.efi if it was installed before
** Windows compatibility
*** Real-time clock
macOS sets BIOS clock to UTC, but Windows sets clock to local time. The solution is to set Windows
to use UTC as well, with =regedit=:

- regedit -> =HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation=
- create new DWORD (32-bit) =RealTimeIsUniversal= with value '1'
*** Sharing Bluetooth devices
You may have noticed you need to re-pair a Bluetooth devices when booting between macOS <-> Windows,
because the 128 bit device link key changes. This can be fixed by exporting macOS's BT keys, and
importing them in Windows. See [[https://github.com/digitalbirdo/BT-LinkkeySync][BT-LinkkeySync]] for instructions, and [[file:tools/BT-LinkkeySync.py][BT-LinkkeySync.py]] in this repo
(updated for Mojave).
** Known problems/caveats
- Drive encryption is disabled (haven't tried)
- Thunderbolt 3 requires Windows configuration (one time), no hotplug support
- USB3 on type-C port not working? Maybe requires cold booting?
- Suspend and resume not implemented properly - power button should wake however
- Internal keyboard behaves strangely when Keyboard SysPrefs are changed - must use SSDT to configure VoodooPS2Controller
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth require card swap, since there are no macOS drivers for OEM Killer Qualcomm card
- Fingerprint reader does not work (see Touch ID / fingerprint reader section)
- SD card reader not present
- HDMI 2.0 output has some quirks (see section), but HDMI 1.4 seems to work
- +VoodooPS2Controller provides poor touchpad support (should be implemented with VoodooI2C probably, TODO)+
* ACPI DSDT/SSDT patching
Most of the ACPI patching info is based on the [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-patching-laptop-dsdt-ssdts.152573/][laptop DSDT/SSDT guide]] and [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-using-clover-to-hotpatch-acpi.200137/][hotpatching guide]].

The ACPIBatteryManager (no longer used) [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-how-to-patch-dsdt-for-working-battery-status.116102/][guide]] includes good step-by-step tutorial on how to make
DSDT edits with [[https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-maciasl-patchmatic/downloads/][MaciASL]].

Many ACPI patches depend on starting out with a working set of ACPI tables (accomplished via
patching if needed), so it's useful to test if this is the case and fix any errors before attempting
further changes.

To do this, we can look through the macOS boot logs for ACPI errors, dump the unmodified ACPI
tables, and dump the ACPI tables as modified by Clover. Making changes as needed, rebooting, and
re-inspecting system logs, we can iterate until there are no more ACPI problems as seen by macOS.

Note: this process wasn't clear to me from reading the patching guides initially, but it may not be
the best way to do it - caveat emptor.

1. Inspect system logs for errors
   Immediately after bootup, dump system log for the last 10 minutes (adjust as needed):
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   log show --predicate 'process == "kernel"' --style syslog --source --debug --last 10m > sys_log.txt
   #+END_SRC
   Then search =sys_log.txt= for "ACPI Error" or "ACPI Exception".
2. Dump unmodified ACPI tables
   Press F4 on Clover boot screen (no output will show), then mount EFI partition and look for
   ACPI tables in =CLOVER/ACPI/origin=.
3. Check unmodified tables for errors with iasl
   Disassembling all tables from a single namespace with the =-da= option should yield no errors:
   =iasl -da -dl DSDT.aml SSDT-*.aml=
   Although, some duplicate definitions with the error AE_ALREADY_EXISTS may not be a problem (TBD).
   If an error occurs, check the file =DSDT.dsl= for possible error output.
4. Check modified tables as injected by Clover with patchmatic and iasl
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   patchmatic -extract
   iasl -da -dl DSDT.aml SSDT-*.aml
   #+END_SRC
   Again, this should yield no errors. If a duplicate definition is found with AE_ALREADY_EXISTS,
   try disassembling the tables without the =-da= option:
   =iasl -dl DSDT.aml SSDT-*.aml=
   If this still fails, there is likely a problem that needs to be fixed via Clover patching first.
* Installation and system updates
** Installation from scratch
*** Preparing the XPS 9570
This setup dual-boots Windows 10, which is nice to have for games, since we can actually use the
NVIDIA GTX 1050, unlike in macOS.

Begin with the default Windows 10 installation (or install Windows 10 if using a new drive).

- Update BIOS and other firmware using Dell SupportAssist in Windows
- Toshiba SSD only
  - Update [[https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/xps-15-9570-laptop/drivers][Toshiba SSD firmware]] (search for "toshiba")
    Needed to fix 4k sector bug. Dell SupportAssist does not do this automatically!
  - Set SSD to [[https://github.com/wmchris/DellXPS15-9550-OSX/blob/master/4k_sector.md][use 4k sectors]] - this will WIPE the drive!
- Enable Intel SpeedShift in BIOS
- TODO: add more steps from original notes.org
*** Creating USB installation media (see [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-booting-the-os-x-installer-on-laptops-with-clover.148093/][guide]] for more details)
- Download macOS install from App Store
- Format USB drive and write installer to drive (assuming drive is =/dev/disk100=)
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk100 1 GPT HFS+J "install_osx" R
  sudo "/Applications/Install macOS Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia" --volume  /Volumes/install_osx --nointeraction
  diskutil rename "Install macOS Mojave" install_osx
  #+END_SRC
- Install Clover on USB drive
  - Using [[https://github.com/Dids/clover-builder][Dids clover build]]: [[https://github.com/Dids/clover-builder/releases][binaries]]
  - Run installer
    - 'Change Install Location' -> Select =install_osx= volume
    - 'Customize', then ensure the following are checked:
      - [X] Clover for UEFI booting only
      - +[X] FSInject-64+ (not needed)
      - +[X] SMCHelper-64+ (do not install - replaced by [[file:EFI/CLOVER/drivers64UEFI/VirtualSmc.efi][VirtualSmc.efi]])
      - [X] ApfsDriverLoader-64
      - +[X] DataHubDxe-64+ (not needed)
      - [X] HFSPlus
  - Mount USB drive's EFI partition
    - =sudo diskutil unmount /Volumes/ESP=
    - =sudo diskutil mount /dev/disk100s1= -> should be mounted to =/Volumes/EFI=
  - Add config.plist for XPS 9570
  - Add kexts to [[file:EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other][EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other]]
  - Add DSDT patches to [[file:EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched][EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched]]
** System updates
Several changes or fixes can stop working after an update, but often only a few steps are required
to fix or re-enable them. Try these steps before debugging issues after updates:

- Update the kext cache (boot with minimal config if necessary)
- Check/re-run power management hibernation changes
* Miscellaneous Notes
** Installing kexts
Kexts should be installed in =/Library/Extensions=.

Installation:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo cp -r <mydriver.kext> /Library/Extensions
sudo chown -R root:wheel /Library/Extensions/<mydriver.kext>
sudo kextcache -i / # update kext cache
#+END_SRC

*Be sure to check output for errors!*

Every custom kext should be listed with the line =Kext with invalid signatured (-67062) allowed=
** Kext patching
Kexts can be patched on boot by Clover (see =KernelAndKextPatches/KextsToPatch= section in
[[file:EFI/CLOVER/config.plist][config.plist]]), but Clover has some limitations, e.g. it can only patch kexts that are in the kext
cache. More complex cases can be handled by [[https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu][Lilu]], used for "arbitrary kext and process patching",
which is itself installed as a [[file:EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other/Lilu.kext][kext]]. Excellent [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/an-idiots-guide-to-lilu-and-its-plug-ins.260063/][guide]] to using Lilu and commonly used plugins.

See also guide to [[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-installing-3rd-party-kexts-el-capitan-sierra-high-sierra-mojave.268964/][installing 3rd party kexts]].
** System Integrity Protection (SIP)
We want to disable SIP to allow loading unapproved kexts and allow other system features that are
normally restricted. This is accomplished by setting =CsrActiveConfig= in config.plist:

- [[file:EFI/CLOVER/config.plist][config.plist]]
  - =RtVariables/CsrActiveConfig=0x3E7=

The bitmask and settings defined by 0x3E7 are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/bt17xk/differences_between_0x67_and_0x3e7/][explained in more detail]] by [[https://www.reddit.com/user/dracoflar][dracoflar]].
** Hackintool
https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/release-hackintool-v2-3-8.254559/ A full-featured utility to fix
various issues, including graphics, USB, audio, etc. Requires a fair bit of reading, but is useful
to verify an installed config or hardware.
** ACPI debugging
The [[https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-ACPI-Debug][OS-X-ACPI-Debug]] repo allows for "debug tracing from ACPI code (DSDT) to system.log".
Not currently installed and not tested, but should be useful if ACPI  problems come up.

* Change history
*** 2019-08-05: Use VoodooI2C for touchpad and touchscreen
Previously VoodooI2C was too unstable, but its reliability seems to have
improved and [[https://github.com/LuletterSoul][LuletterSoul]] provided a patch for GPIO interrupts in [[https://github.com/LuletterSoul/Dell-XPS-15-9570-macOS-Mojave][his repo]].
*** 2019-07-26: Upgrade to 10.14.6
No issues.
*** 2019-05-30: Update CsrActiveConfig bitmask to 0x3E7
This new value seems to be a better choice for 10.14.5 as recommended by dracoflar,
who also gave several other very helpful tips for this repo.
*** 2019-05-26: Remove unnecessary SMBIOS entries and clover UEFI drivers
*** 2019-05-23: Clean up ACPI renaming/patches with WhateverGreen
WhateverGreen now handles ACPI renames and backlight fixes, so unnecessary ACPI patches and
AppleBacklightFixup are removed.
*** 2019-05-21: Use VirtualSMC instead of FakeSMC
Currently provides no new features, but VirtualSMC is more actively maintained than FakeSMC.
Do open an issue if you run into problems with VirtualSMC however.
*** 2019-05-19: Update clover and use single EFI folder
*** 2019-05-17: Upgrade to 10.14.5
Noticed a few kextd stalls with the message:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
busy timeout[0], (240s) kextd wait(0): 'AppleACPICPU'
#+END_SRC

Update completes after waiting a while.
*** 2019-05-13: Add support for dual DisplayPort via type C
The type C connector supports up to two 4k@60Hz DisplayPort outputs with an adapter. The HDMI output
can be used simultaneously, for up to three displays (including the LCD). A Thunderbolt 3 adapter
is recommended to get 60Hz and other benefits.
*** 2019-04-29: Add initial HDMI support
@0xFireWolf created patches to enable Type C and HDMI connected output. This will likely require
more changes to support HDMI 2.0 fully.
*** 2019-04-01: Use WhateverGreen for DPCD link rate patching
@0xFireWolf has added DPCD link rate patching to WhateverGreen, which is available with commit
ab43814f45, or with the next release (1.2.8 probably). A WhateverGreen kext with these changes is
also included with this repo.
*** 2019-03-26: Upgrade to 10.14.4
This update takes quite some time on initial install, so it may be necessary to wait more than 20
minutes before seeing a progress bar.

AppleIntelCFLGraphicsFramebuffer changed again, and this time the DPCD link rate patch needs to be
updated. See changes in the Intel UHD 630 "enabling acceleration section".
